# LEAP
My work consisted both in the content part and in the graphic part. My part was less UX design and more graphic design. I also focused on the content part of this project. Psychology played a significant role in our project, as it was intended to serve the purpose of enhancing well-being and productivity.
Graphically, I contributed to the visual elements of the app. I solved the choice of color palette and approved other elements. I participated in the creation of the name and the logo.
