# MY PROJECT

## 1) CZECH TENNIS
This is a school project that I worked on together with my classmate. I’m proud of this project because I know it taught both of us patience, greater attention to detail, and strengthened our motivation. Although the assignment was fictional, it was fantastic. The topic was tennis, which I have a personal connection to. With this project, we were able to showcase what we have learned so far.

## 2) EPRAVO
Project EPRAVO. It is a redesign of a legal magazine. A group school project that taught me a lot. From typesetting rules to editing covers, and collaborating with the best team.

### 3) THE AUTHENTIC MEDIA
This is my new current and professional project. I create Instagram content, marketing strategies, and much more. I can be creative, have a strong voice, and work with amazing people. I see great potential in the company and I’m excited to see where it will go. I am very satisfied with my "job."
