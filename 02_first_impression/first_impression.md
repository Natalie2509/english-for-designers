# MY PROJECT

## READABILITY AND SIMPLICITY
Cleanliness, orderliness, consistency.
These are words that, in my opinion, describe both good design and the work itself and the process of creation.
A clean and clear dsign is the basis for success. For creator and consumer.
It's not the basic concept of minimalism, I'm convinced that even a large comprehensive design can be clean and clear. Organized chaos works.


## EPRAVO
Project EPRAVO. It is a redesign of a legal magazine. A group school project that taught me a lot. From typesetting rules to editing covers, and collaborating with the best team.

Let me know if you need any adjustments!



### INERESTIGN COLOR COMBOS
This is an strange topic for me. Everyone experiences their own reality. Everyone has a different perception of the world. Different bervas have different impressions on everyone.
Example with black paint: Someone perceives black as a strong, elegant and dignified colour, another person may perceive it as a sign of darkness.
what does it affect? Point of view? Method of education? Environmental influence? Current mood? (Maybe Color blindness?)
Probably all at once... It's just very interesting to me.
