# MY PROJECT

## READABILITY AND SIMPLICITY
Cleanliness, orderliness, consistency.
These are words that, in my opinion, describe both good design and the work itself and the process of creation.
A clean and clear dsign is the basis for success. For creator and consumer.
It's not the basic concept of minimalism, I'm convinced that even a large comprehensive design can be clean and clear. Organized chaos works.


## EPRAVO
Project EPRAVO. It is a redesign of a legal magazine. A group school project that taught me a lot. From typesetting rules to editing covers, and collaborating with the best team.



### THE AUTHENTIC MEDIA
This is my new current and professional project. I create Instagram content, marketing strategies, and much more. I can be creative, have a strong voice, and work with amazing people. I see great potential in the company and I’m excited to see where it will go. I am very satisfied with my "job."
