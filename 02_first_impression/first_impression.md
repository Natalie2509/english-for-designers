# MY PROJECT

## 1) CZECH TENNIS
This is a school project that I worked on together with my classmate. I’m proud of this project because I know it taught both of us patience, greater attention to detail, and strengthened our motivation. Although the assignment was fictional, it was fantastic. The topic was tennis, which I have a personal connection to. We spent a lot of time designing the logo. We had interesting and valuable consultations. With this project, we were able to showcase what we have learned so far.

## 2) EPRAVO
Project EPRAVO. It is a redesign of a legal magazine. A group school project that taught me a lot. From typesetting rules to editing covers, and collaborating with the best team.

## 3) THE AUTHENTIC MEDIA
This is my new current and professional project. I create Instagram content, marketing strategies, and much more. I can be creative and work with amazing people. I see great potential in the company and I’m excited to see where it will go. I am very satisfied with my "job."

## 4) LEAP
The LEAP project is unique in its theme. It was a psychological, playful app designed to motivate people every day. The mobile app generated one task per day for the user. The app was very diverse and colorful. The LEAP project was also a team effort. We were a large team, but we worked well together. Currently, our project is displayed at Prague's Náplavka. I can imagine that the project could be realized, and people would be able to install the app on their phones.
